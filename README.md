ðŸ’¡ Project: Admin Panel â€” React & Node.js (CRUD)
Description:
I have developed an Admin Panel using React.js for the frontend and Node.js (with FS module) for the backend.

In this project:

ðŸ‘‰ Frontend is designed using React.js along with shadcn/ui components for a clean, modern, and reusable UI.
ðŸ‘‰ I have implemented dynamic forms, tables, and interactive UI components to manage data.
ðŸ‘‰ Backend is built on Node.js, where data is handled through the fs module (file system) for read, write, update, and delete (CRUD) operations in a local db.json file.
ðŸ‘‰ The application supports full CRUD functionality:

Create: Add new records.

Read: Fetch & display data dynamically.

Update: Edit existing data.

Delete: Remove records securely.

âœ¨ Iâ€™ve also handled:

API integration using Axios with proper error handling.

Frontend and backend communication through REST API.

User-friendly alert and console logs for real-time feedback.

This project helped me to strengthen:

Component-based development.

State management.

Backend data flow.

File handling using Node's fs module.

Practical CRUD implementations.
